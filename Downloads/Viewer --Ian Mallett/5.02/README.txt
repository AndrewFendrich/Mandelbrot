Mandelbrot Set Viewer
by Ian Mallett

Version 5.0 is the spiritual successor to Mandelbrot Set Viewer, although to my memory it inherits no code.  I wrote the basics of it right in front of someone, just to demonstrate.  I then went back and added many of the features in the original series.

Look through the variables in config.py, which will change the rendering properties.  Also, if the program crashes, look there for information about what to change in the shader to try to fix it.

Enjoy!
